      <p style="font-size: xl;">A gap year generally spans a year-long break from formal education or work. It offers students a prolonged period to explore various interests, cultures, and career opportunities.</p>
      <p style="font-size: xl;">It is mostly seen that many students opt for gap years after completing intermediate or during their undergraduate studies to enrich their life experiences before committing to further education.</p>
      <p style="font-size: xl;">Gap periods, on the other hand, are short breaks which range from a few months to a year. These breaks are more flexible and can occur at different stages of one's educational journey.</p>
      <p style="font-size: xl;">Students might take gap periods between secondary school and college, during undergraduate studies, or before pursuing postgraduate education abroad. These periods provide opportunities for focused experiences, skill development, or language learning.</p>
